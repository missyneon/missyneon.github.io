          <p>Figure 1 shows the overall crime count trend (excluding Drugs and Anti-Social Behaviour) from January 2020 to May 2021, with crime count trends from previous years as comparison. As illustrated in Figure 1, 2020 goes through a relatively huge crime dip in April compared to the crime trend on the same month previous years. This is due to the UK lockdown that went into effect on March 23rd, resulting in the first full month of lockdown occuring in April 2020. Then as the lockdown restrictions were relaxed from May 2020 to August 2020, crime started to go back up until it was reached a point in August 2020 that was similar to crime counts in August from previous years.<br><br>Throughtout the month of September 2020, lockdown restrictions were put in place for some local areas due to the resurgence in covid cases. This led to a second steady decline in crime for the whole of September. Crime continued to go down in October 2020, albeit not as drastically as the previous month. However, the second "firebreak" lockdown was put into effect from October 23rd to November 9th and a subsequent third lockdown on December 26th, which led to a decline in crime from November 2020 to February 2020, which was as steep as the crime dip that occured from March 2020 to April 2020. <br><br>Finally, lockdown restrictions started getting relaxed starting from early March 2021 till May 2021, resulting in crime climbing back to pre-pandemic crime levels from March 2021 to May 2021. This is the macro-level crime trend which will be broken down in the following sections in order to analyze the contributions of different crime types and local areas to this trend.</p>

            <p>Figure 2 shows the crime count trend of different types of crime from January 2020 to May 2021, with crime count trends of different crime types from previous years as comparison. From the figure above, it can be observed that Violence/sexual offences, burglary, theft from the person, other theft and shoplifting were the crime types whose 2020 trends aligned the most with the overall crime trend in Figure 1, leading to the conclusion that overall crime in Wales consisted mainly of these crime types. </p>

        <div class="statement">
            <p>Figure 3 shows the gini coefficients (statistical measure of the degree of variation or inequality that goes from 0 to 1; the closer to 1 that the gini coefficient is, the more unevenly distributed that crime is across Wales) of the different crime types and for the same time period in Figure 2. From Figure 3, it can be observed that gini coefficients of Violence/sexual offences, Burglary, theft from the person, criminal damage/arson and shoplifting are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violence/sexual offences: ~0.375</li>
                <li>Burglary: ~0.5</li>
                <li>Theft from the person: ~0.5 to ~0.8</li>
                <li>Other theft: ~0.5</li>
                <li>Shoplifting: ~0.75</li>
                <li>Criminal damage/arson: ~0.5</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>The gini coeffients above suggest that different crime types have varying degrees of distribution across Wales, i.e. among the 6 crimes listed above, Violence/sexual offences was the most evenly distributed, Theft from the person and shoplifting were the least distributed, while burglary, criminal damage/arson and other theft were somewhere in the middle with some degree of unequal distribution across Wales. In the following section, crime per MSOA region will be further analyzed.</p>

        <div class="statement">
            <p>Figure 4 is a k-longitudinal cluster plot containing six clusters of all MSOA regions in Wales. Each cluster plot consists of MSOA regions with crime levels of the same range, and each illustrates the contribution of each MSOA cluster to the overall crime trend. The solid lines represent the mean crime count for each cluster at any given point in time from January 2018 to May 2021. The violin shapes represent the variation around the mean crime count for each month. <br><br>The cluster plot shows that the mean crime level clusters B and C was relatively low (the mean number of total crimes per month was ~25), the overall crime trend for 2020 was relatively stable, and there was relatively little variation of monthly MSOA crime counts around the mean MSOA crime count for about half of MSOA regions in Wales, which happened to be in clusters B and C (47.8% of MSOA regions in Wales). The mean crime levels for clusters A and D (44.4% of MSOA regions in Wales) were relatively a little higher (mean number of total crimes per month were ~50 for cluster A and approximately ~60 for cluster D) than those of clusters B and C, while the overall crime trend for 2020 was relatively stable as well, although there was a slight dip in April that eventaully stabilized by August. The variation of monthly MSOA crime counts around the mean MSOA crime count was slightly more than that of clusters B and C, which makes sense due to the slight instability that these clusters’ 2020 crime trends experienced. The mean crime level for cluster E (6.6% of MSOA regions in Wales) was significantly higher (mean number of total crimes per month was ~100 for cluster E) than that of clusters A, B, C, and D, and the variation of monthly MSOA crime counts around the mean MSOA crime count was slightly more than that of clusters A, B, C, and D. Cluster E’s overall crime trend for 2020 was also noticeably more unstable than that of clusters A, B, C, and D, with a larger dip around April, a subsequent stabilization around August and a more gradual decline from September to December. However, the mean crime level (mean number of total crimes per month was ~150 to ~300 for cluster F), crime trend instability, and variation around the mean crime count in cluster F were the highest by far, with only 1.22% of MSOA regions not only contributing the greatest number of crimes to the overall crime trend in Wales, but also aligning the most with the overall crime trend in Figure 1 in terms of declines and increases in 2020. </p>

            <p>Figures 5 - 10 are 6 different maps of the Wales MSOA outline, each pinpointing the crime counts that belong to MSOA areas in each of the 6 clusters.

On the other hand, clusters B and C contain the largest number of MSOA regions, despite contributing the least to the overall crime trend. This is in line with the cluster plot in Figure 4.

            <p>Figure 11 is a bar plot that shows the monthly change of crime count and percentage of total positive or negative change for each cluster from January 2020 to May 2021.<br><br>As illustrated by the overall crime trend in Figure 1, crimes from all clusters experienced some level of decline from March 2020 to April 2020. That said, the MSOA regions from clusters E and F contributed the most to the crime drop, i.e., 43% of the total crime drop, despite comprising of only 7.82% of all MSOA regions in Wales. In contrast, MSOA regions from clusters B and C contributed the least, i.e., 15%, to the total crime drop, despite making up 47.8% of all MSOA regions in Wales, while the contribution of MSOA regions from clusters A and D was somewhere in the middle, i.e., 39% to the total crime drop, despite comprising of 44.4% of all MSOA regions in Wales. This is in line with the cluster analysis that shows that overall crime in Wales was largely driven by a small number of areas that belong to clusters E and especially F.<br><br>As crime started to climb back up from April 2020 to May 2020, the contributions of clusters B and C increased (28% from April 2020 to May 2020), albeit by an amount that is still relatively small considering that clusters B and C contain almost half of the MSOA regions in Wales. On the other hand, the contributions of clusters E and F from April 2020 to May 2020 reduced to 3% in total, which aligns with the deceleration of the rate at which overall crime went up during this same period. However, the contributions of clusters A and D to overall crime during this time increased to 67%, which is an increase that is still disproportionately small compared to the number of MSOA regions in these clusters. During this period, it can be observed that the monthly crime change of clusters A to D was much larger than that of the overall crime trend, unlike the monthly crime change of clusters E and F, whose monthly crime change from April 2020 to May 2020 fits the overall crime change in Figure 1 during this same period.<br><br>From May 2020 to June 2020, the contributions of clusters B and C increased, albeit by just a little less than during the previous period (23% from May 2020 to June 2020). This is also a relatively small amount like in the previous period, as clusters B and C contain almost half of the MSOA regions in Wales. However, the contributions of clusters E and F from May 2020 to June 2020 increased to 24%, which aligns with the acceleration of the rate at which overall crime went up during this same period. Finally, the contributions of clusters A and D to overall crime during this time increased to 53%, which is an increase that is disproportionately small compared to the number of MSOA regions in these clusters, just like in the previous period. During May 2020 to June 2020, it can be observed that the monthly crime changes in clusters A to D continued the monthly crime change trend of being much larger than that of the overall crime trend, unlike the monthly crime change of clusters E and F, whose monthly crime change from May 2020 to June 2020 fits the overall crime change in Figure 1 during this same period.<br><br>From June 2020 to July 2020, the contributions of clusters B and C increased by approximately the same amount as much as during the previous period (21% from May 2020 to June 2020). This is also a relatively small amount like in the previous period, as clusters B and C contain almost half of the MSOA regions in Wales. Like in previous periods, the contributions of clusters E and F from May 2020 to June 2020 increased to 35%, which aligns with the acceleration of the rate at which overall crime went up during this same period.<br><br>Finally, the contributions of clusters A and D to overall crime during this time increased to 53%, which is an increase that is disproportionately small compared to the number of MSOA regions in these clusters, just like in the previous period. During June 2020 to July 2020, it can be observed that just like from May 2020 to June 2020, the monthly crime changes in clusters A to D continued the trend of being much larger than that of the overall crime trend, unlike the monthly crime change of clusters E and F, whose monthly crime change from June 2020 to July 2020 fits the overall crime change in Figure 1 during this same period. The month-to-month crime change from July 2020 to May 2021 continued with a similar trend; crime change from all clusters increased or decreased at an amount that is disproportionate to the number of MSOA regions in these clusters, and clusters E and F were the only clusters whose crime trends fit the overall crime trend in Figure 1.

        <div class="statement">
            <p>Figure 12 shows the monthly contributions of each crime type to overall crime. From the figure above, it can be observed that the crime types in clusters A to D (areas with low to mid crime levels) have relatively stable proportions from January 2020 to December 2020, with violence/sexual offences contributing the most to overall monthly crime, followed by public order, criminal damage/arson, burglary, and finally other theft. However, the crime types in clusters E and F (areas with high crime levels) have relatively unstable proportions, with the proportions of violence/sexual offences in clusters E and F being less than those in other clusters. On the other hand, the proportions of shoplifting, public order, theft from the person, bicycle theft, other theft, and criminal damage/arson increased in that order, compared to those in the low to mid crime clusters, with bicycle theft contributing a larger proportion to cluster F. This suggests that a large change in crime opportunities occurred in a handful of local areas located in clusters E and F. The section below explores the relationship between crime and structres that serve as crime opportunity areas.</p>

            <p>Figure 13 is a spearman rank correlation plot that illustrates the correlation between the mean overall crime count and the number of structures in each MSOA cluster. A spearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test that is used to calculate the level of association between two variables. The spearman rank correlation coefficient is between -1 and 1. A coefficient of -1 or values close to -1 indicates that a strong negative correlation between x and y ( as x increasess, y decreases). Conversely, a coefficient of 1 or values close to 1 indicates that a strong positive correlation between x and y (as x increases, y increases).<br><br>Figure 13 shows that the spearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.943, meaning that the mean crime count of a region is strongly related to the number of structures in the area (i.e. nightclubs, convenience stores, pubs, car park, bicycle parks, malls and other crime opportunity structures). The plot also shows that cluster E and F had the highest mean crime count out of all the clusters, which explains why the MSOA regions in these clusters contributed more to crime than the regions in other clusters.<br><br>Based on all the analysis done, it can be concluded that the covid lockdowns resulted in a small handful of regions driving most of overall crime trend in Wales due to the fact that there is a much higher number of crime opportunity structures in these local areas than in any other part of Wales. </p>
